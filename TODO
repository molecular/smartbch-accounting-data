TODO

	* make "abiNames": ["FlexUSDImplV2","sep20"] work and then
		* change output filename <method>.csv to <abi_name>.<method>.csv

	* event order is by blockNumber only. There should be some addition in-block sequence number that needs to be used to not screw up the balance tracking and interest payment calculation <- maybe transaction_index? edit: log_index?

	* EXPONENTIAL_AT isn't working. Some output are 7.6E-17, for example

	* I'm pretty sure the balance tracker will fail with transfers where to and from are both in config.my_addresses
		* maybe separate the trackBalances from generateSyntheticEvents as a start, trackBalance could be useful for other things

  * maybe change "from(address)" => "from:address" in column naming for consistency?

  * why I have to add routers_masterchefs to config.ts?
    * example where this is biting us:
      * 0xe7972ab470f782d38b4209c3db1cf05bbe5f2e931e4ce2b9b5d6c66af54b116d (removeEthLiquidity): the transfer of WBCH from LP contract to Router is not currently grabbed by us
    * potential solution: instead of tryint to craft patterns that grab this stuff, why not simply get the logs of all transactions?

  * clean out/ directory at beginning to avoid stale data

  * maybe the event decoder can be used from some npm dependency instead of copied into local sources from smartscan (abi-coder?)
