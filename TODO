TODO

 * format dates in CSV so openoffice/excel understand it
 * output format divider decimals is fixed, but should be taken from contract data
 * make "abiNames": ["FlexUSDImplV2","sep20"] work and then
 	* change output filename <method>.csv to <abi_name>.<method>.csv
 * event order is by blockNumber only. There should be some addition in-block sequence number that needs to be used to not screw up the balance tracking and interest payment calculation
 * EXPONENTIAL_AT isn't working. Some output are 7.6E-17, for example
