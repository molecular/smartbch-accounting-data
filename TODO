TODO

	* format dates in CSV so openoffice/excel understand it
	* make "abiNames": ["FlexUSDImplV2","sep20"] work and then
		* change output filename <method>.csv to <abi_name>.<method>.csv
	* event order is by blockNumber only. There should be some addition in-block sequence number that needs to be used to not screw up the balance tracking and interest payment calculation <- maybe transaction_index?
	* EXPONENTIAL_AT isn't working. Some output are 7.6E-17, for example
	* instead of "0x7b2B3C5308ab5b2a1d9a94d20D35CCDf61e05b72"  use contractManager.getContractByName("flexUSD")
	* I'm pretty sure the balance tracker will fail with transfers where to and from are both in config.my_addresses
		* maybe separate the trackBalances from generateSyntheticEvents as a start, trackBalance could be useful for other things
	* type events by creating interface Event?
  * maybe change "from(address)" => "from:address" in column naming for consistency?
  * decide wether to use own SmartBCHApi api or the stuff copied over from smartscan
